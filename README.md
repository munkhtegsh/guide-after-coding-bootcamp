### A guidance for get a job in a Three months after graduating the Coding Bootcamp

Congratulations for graduating your coding bootcamp. So proud of you because you've worked so hard to get familiar with Computer Science concepts and gained more experience in coding practices. No matter which coding bootcamp you've graduated and what coding languages you've learned, we all have the same goal next. Getting your first dev job will take some time depends on your technical skills, experiences and luck. This open-source project with the support of the community intent to help you to get a job in three months.

#### Why do I need the guidance? 

Unlike you were in the bootcamp, you are on your own at this stage. Majority of Coding Bootcamps don’t provide well prepared career ready programs. It means, there will be no mentor’s help, colleagues support and well prepared classes. Also many job seekers discouraged by rejection emails after submitting their resume countless times. It makes them feel helpless and stack in one place. Following this plan will help you to overcome your struggles and make you the strongest candidate for the potential employers.

#### Is three months enough time to get a job?

According to [2018 Coding Bootcamp Industry and Outcomes Report](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/coding-bootcamp-survey), the average job search length is 8 week of finishing a bootcamp.
