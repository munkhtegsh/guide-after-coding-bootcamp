#### Why do I need a Three months plan?

Unlike you were in the bootcamp, you are on your own at this stage. Majority of Coding Bootcamps don’t provide well prepared career ready programs. It means, there will be no mentor’s help, colleagues support and well prepared classes. Also many of us discouraged by rejection emails after submitting countless times our resume. It makes us helpless and feel stack in one place. Following this plan will help you to overcome it and make you strongest candidate for the potential employers.

#### Isn’t it too long time for get a job?

According to [2018 Coding Bootcamp Industry and Outcomes Report](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/coding-bootcamp-survey). The average job search length was 8 week of finishing a bootcamp.
